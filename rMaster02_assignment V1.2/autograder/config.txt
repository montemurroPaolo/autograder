@ All Functions
expect_equal("return", 3) # delete this
25
Each function should have one return() command
Good: Your functions correctly each have a return() command
---
Ex 1 - BadFn
expect_equal(badFn(5),badFn_sol(5),tolerance=1E-9)
10
Incorrect value for badFn(5)
---
Ex 1 - BadFn
expect_equal(badFn(-5),badFn_sol(-5),tolerance=1E-9)
10
Incorrect value for badFn(-5)
---
Ex 2 Black Scholes
expect_equal( blackScholesCall(100,90,1,0.0,0.2), blackScholesCall_sol(100,90,1,0.0,0.2), tolerance=1E-9 )
20
Your Black Scholes function produces incorrect results when r=0
Good: Your Black Scholes function produces correct results when r=0
---
Ex 2 Black Scholes
expect_equal( blackScholesCall(100,90,1,0.1,0.2), blackScholesCall_sol(100,90,1,0.1,0.2), tolerance=1E-9 )
20
Your Black Scholes function produces incorrect results when r>0
Good: Your Black Scholes function produces correct results when r>0
---
Ex 3
expect_equal( dcinterest(0.1,4), dcinterest_sol(0.1,4), tolerance=1E-9 )
15
Your dcinterest produces incorrect values for a duration of 4 years
---
#Ex 3
#expect_equal( dcinterest(0.08,6.5), dcinterest_sol(0.08,6.5), tolerance=1E-9 )
#25
#Your dcinterest produces incorrect values for a duration of 6.5 years
#---
#Ex 3
#!expect_equal( dcinterest(0.1,3.5), dcinterest_simple(0.1,3.5), tolerance=1E-9 )
#25
#Your dcinterest treats fractional years (e.g. 6.5 years) in a too simple way. You need to distinguish whole years from fractional years and treat them differently.
